		<h1> Christine Llapitan</h1>
		
		<h2>Full-Stack Web Developer</h2>

		<p class="bio">I am a student of Tuitt Coding Bootcamp, participating now on HTML, CSS and JavaScipt coding. Hoping to have more knowledge on the next days and weeks. 
		I want to develop website that will mesmerize my audience. A friendly user, mobile friendly website that everyone can visit and use. I want coding to be my hobby. 
		I also want to put up a small business, like a cafe where in me and my future partner can cook and give service to our customers.</p>
